Science Bowl has always been a part of my life.
It's been there for me through life's great ups and downs, the twists and turns, the random times I feel like a poet and defy grammar.
It's always been a vent for my anxiety.
I decided to apply to be captain and got in a while back and everything changed.

I didn't know what I was doing for a while.
My co-captain was definitely a huge source of support while I was figuring out the ropes, but there were still some things I had to figure out on my own.

I'd like to help out those who come in the future by writing a guide for these future captains.
I've used $\LaTeX$ for both my own and everyone who's gotta look at it's viewing pleasure.
Asking my club advisor, I've made sure that all incoming captains get a copy as soon as they get the position.
