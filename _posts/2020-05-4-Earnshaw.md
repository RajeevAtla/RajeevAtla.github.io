So it's come to my attention that my blog doesn't really have that many EM problems on it, so I decided to prove Earnshaw's theorem.
But what really is Earnshaw's Theorem and why should you care? That's what we talk about in this blog post.

## Earnshaw's Theorem: The Statement

Earnshaw's Theorem states that a system of charges cannot cause a charge to be in stable equilibrium.

## Earnshaw's Theorem: The Proof

You can look at any decent electrodynamics book for a formal proof, but that's not why we're here.
The purpose of this blog is to make less people hate physics, and I can tell from experience that a formal proof does the opposite (•_•) ( •_•)>⌐■-■ (⌐■_■).

So here we go:
