It's been a great summer, and I hope I really get to interact with the people I talked to over the summer.

I did some physics problems, some physics research, and had a lot of fun.
It's really the perfect balance of things.
I've also gotten a decent amount of college applications done, so I trully think balance was acheived here.

I often feel like life is a gyroscope.
There are 3 principal ways of movement: translation and rotation about 2 different axes.
Translation is simply done by you, the gyroscope, and you can move forward with almost no effort.
This is much akin to time-translation.

On the other hand is the more complex motion: the two different rotation axes.
Let one axis $\theta \in \left[0, 2 \pi \right]$ represent fun and another axis $\phi \in \left[0, 2 \pi \right]$ represent work.
If we let $\theta$ or $\phi$ stray too far from their central values of $\pi$, everything goes crazy and all hell breaks loose.
This is when crazy amounts of gyration happen.
If you have too much or too little of fun or work, then they start to affect each other.

And that... is very bad.
The point of this complicated example is that burnout is real kids (sorry if this comes off a bit condescending (ᵔᴥᵔ)).
But having too much fun and not making any progress is also a bad thing if done in excess.
So the key takeaway should be: balance!

Good luck at school this year everyone!
