So I cam across a problem when I was doing some EM that I want to share with you today.

## Problem (BAUPC 1997)

Consider a region of space in which there is a magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B} = B \boldsymbol{\hat{z}}$ pointing in the direction. A particle of charge $q$ is given an initial velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_0 = v_0 \boldsymbol{\hat{y}}$.
