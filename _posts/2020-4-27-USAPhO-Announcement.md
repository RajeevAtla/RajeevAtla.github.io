New announcement from my side: I'll be test-solving the USAPhO this Tuesday (4/28).
See my [previous post]({{ site.url }}/misc/2020/04/16/USAPhO-is-cancelled.html) for more information.

Since then, there's been [another announcement from AAPT](https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2020/news.cfm) (see 4/24).
There will be a webinar, which I will do my best to attend.

I will try and educate people on the ways of doing physics while solving the problems and will not be consulting the official solutions.
