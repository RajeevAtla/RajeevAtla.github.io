All my life I've had this fear, and I suppose my Enneagram Type 3 matches up, of being worthless and being exposed to everyone about this.
It's going to be there, no matter what.
And this post is about me coming to terms with it.

It starts sophomore year: I'm trying out for Science Bowl and have done a good amount of practice.
Enough, in fact, to beat everyone who was trying out for my subjects: physics and math.
I even did so with a really high margin: I had >50 points in each, while everyone else had less than 25.
I waited for the email from the team captains that said there was a mistake, but I'm still waiting for it.

This drastic change, I've now realized, was caused by me actually studying.
It wasn't luck or the misfortune of those who were also there that day.
It was skill.
At the time, I thought otherwise.
I expected to have just studied the right things, done the right problems, and was in that position by sheer luck.

As a result of this fear, I always uncomfortable on the team.
I always felt like someone who couldn't pull his own weight and didn't deserve my spot on the team.
I felt bad for whoever's spot I had taken - they were supposed to be here, not me.
It was almost like I had cheated my way onto the team.

But despite this, I *really trully* loved my time on the team.
It was great: we were called a team for a reason and had a lot of camaraderie for a reason.
But to feel that camaraderie and really experience that fuzzy feeling in your gut, you had to feel like you **belonged**.
These two feelings competed in my brain, and for the entirety of the year, I felt like I didn't belong, but desperately wanted to.

This, almost paradoxically, is what led me to apply to be a captain.
The thing was, in my mind, being a captain was just making sure the logistics of everything worked.
And for the most part, that was true.
This meant that, unlike the other team members, I was a bit different, and this would get rid of this feeling that I was different by making me actually embrace the fact that I was a bit different.
But then came the actual leadership part - having people look towards you, as a leader.

For some people, like the captain before me, this came naturally.
He just exuded that confidence and charisma like it was his middle name.
Naturally, I felt like I was in his shadow.

And this just worsened the imposter syndrome I had been feeling up to that point.
I wasn't up for this position: why me over the other people who had applied.
Now that I was captain, I could actually look at their applications and see how much they *glowed* and mine didn't.
My application was woefully inadquate compared to theirs and it was a gap that could never be overcome.

Again, here I was, waiting for an email that said that there had been a mistake, and I wasn't really stuck in the prison known as the captaincy.
And I'm still waiting.

Eventually, I got through junior year.
At the end, my gut told me that if I applied to more leadership positions, people would see me as fit to be a leader.
This just made my problems worse.

I now had 4 leadership positions.
I was supposed to feel like a leader, but was I really?
I looked around me, seeing a sea of talented people, who could have easily gotten these positions - every single one of them.
I had usurped their plans, and didn't really deserve to be in charge, at all.
In short, I felt like a fraud.

I was never going to be enough, I told myself.
And I would have simply resigned all my positions, leaving them to those I though more qualified.
After all, not everyone was cut-out to be the leader.

Before I decided to give up, I wanted to reach out for help: a romantic last stand, if you will.
I tried explaining these thoughts to someone I thought could help me: a friend, who was also family, whom I trusted with everything.

She pounded some sense into me: if no one believed in me, why would I be in this position?
If I wasn't worth it in the first place, why would I get this position?
Why would the past Science Bowl captain, who was super good at his job, entrust this job to me.?

I wasn't really a failure, until I completely stopped believing in myself.
I was the one that was picked, not them.
That didn't make me automatically better than them, but it didn't make me any worse either.
I had been put in these positions for a reason, after all.

I quickly realized that someone believed in me; believed in me enough to entrust this position.
I couldn't turn my back on them and just leave.
Not without trying.

So the imposter syndrome is still there, and I still have nagging doubts about whether or not I deserved anything.
I try not to think about how people are watching my every move.
I try not to think about if and when I mess up.
But I promise myself and my teammates I will remember my mistakes and learn from them.

I wasn't born a leader, but I can definitely inch myself towards becoming one.
