I've realized that there are very few topics of physics covered on this site, so this post is meant to fix it a little bit.
Let's do a thermodynamics problem today then.
So let's start with some discussion of the equiparition theorem: what exactly is it and why should you really care?
After all, equipartition is a pretty big word and you would have probably tuned out by now if a professor was lecturing about this.
This is important some problems, like the one we will solve today!
