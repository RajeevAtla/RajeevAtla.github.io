First of all, happy Pi Day!!! 
Time to get to the physics.
I found this Princeton problem looking at old quals for fun.

It turned out to be really interesting, so here we are.

## Princeton Physics Preliminary Exams J98M.1 - Hanging Rope
Problem found [here](https://phy.princeton.edu/sites/physics/files/graduate-program/prelims/J98.pdf).

### Problem Statement
A piece of thin uniform unstretchable rope has length $2L$ and mass $M$.
Its ends are attached to points at the same height separated by distance $2 w$ and the rope hangs between them under the influence of gravity (of course $w < L$).
Let us set up coordinates $(x,y)$ in the plane of the rope, so that the end points have equal values of $y$ and $x = \pm w$.
You will be asked to determine the vertical coordinate of the rope, $y$, as a function of $x$.

1. Write down the functional of $y(x)$ that has to be minimized. What is the form of the constraint?
2. One may think of the functional to be minimized as the action as an for a 1-dimensional particle with coordinate $y$ and time $x$. Find a conserved quantity.
3. For a given value of the conserved quantity, find $y(x)$. What is the equation relating the conserved quantity to $w$ and $L$?

### Solution
#### Part 1
The potential energy must be minimized
